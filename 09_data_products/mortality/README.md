### Overview:

This app uses U.S. mortality rates, published by the Society of Actuaries in 2014, and other demographics to predict the probability of a U.S. employee's dying in the following year.  To use the tool, select an employee's industry, gender, and age from the drop-downs below.  After the three parameters are selected, the tool will report the annual mortality rate (probability of death) for the given demographics.

The app also provides an industry-wide mortality curve for both genders.  It illustrates the annual probability of death for males and females for the designated industry (white collar, blue collar, or both) as indicated by the 'industry' drop-down menu.
